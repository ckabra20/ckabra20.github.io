        I was born and brought up in India. I have spent most of my life before college in Navi Mumbai.<br>
        I attended Delhi Public School (DPS) Navi Mumbai where I completed my high school education.<br>
        Overall, I have grown up amongst a diverse range of individuals and experiences, which has helped me <br>
        tremendously in my personal and professional life.</dd>

        Currently, I am a junior in University of Wisconsin-Madison, doing a double major in Computer Sciences and Data Science. <br>

        capabilities

        1. I worked as a Data Scientist intern at Reliance Jio, which is India's fastest growing telecom company during the summer break after <br>
        my freshman year. <br>
        2. I worked as an SDE intern at Amazon, Seattle last summer where I gained first-hand experience in the complete software-development <br>
        life-cycle and built a project for my team's internal SDE debugging usage.
        3. I have worked as a Peer Mentor and Undergrad Teaching Assistant for Comp Sci 220, which is a fundamental Data Science course. <br>
        I held OH, created and refreshed projects, designed and reviewed quizzes etc. to help deliver a great learning experience to the <br>
        students enrolled in this course.
